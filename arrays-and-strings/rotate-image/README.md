Problem:
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

1. The matrix is n x n, so it will always have the same length and [i].length
2. The length of the matrix - 1 is the amount of places a digit moves, for example, if the matrix length is 3 x 3, each digit moves 3 - 1 (2) times
