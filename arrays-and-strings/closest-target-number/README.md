Problem: 
Given an array of integers nums and a target integer, find the number in nums that's closest to the target.

Initial though process:
1. Loop through the array and find the closest integer by subtracting the target to the current integer
2. Store the closest integer in a variable

Improvements:
1. Handling negative values by getting the absolute value
