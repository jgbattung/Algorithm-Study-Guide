Given an array of integers Nums, return True if there is any dupl;icate value in the array and false if there is none

Initial thoughts
1. First approach would be a double loop, where you check if the current number has any same numbers in the array
2. Check if the current number is the same as the compared number
3. Make sure that the current index is not the number itself

Improved:
1. Use Set
