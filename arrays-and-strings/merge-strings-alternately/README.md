Problem:
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Initial thoughts:
1. Turn both words into arrays, array1 and array2
2. Loop through the combined length of both arrays
3. Concat the arrays, alternating
4. Join the array
