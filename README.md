# Algorithm Study Guide

A systematic approach to mastering JavaScript algorithms and data structures. This repository documents my journey of learning and implementing common algorithmic patterns, preparing for technical interviews, and improving problem-solving skills.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Master fundamental algorithm patterns and data structures
- Document problem-solving approaches and thought processes
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews
- Create a reference for future review and learning

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Solving Approach

For each problem, I follow these steps:

1. **Understanding**
   - Write down the problem constraints
   - Analyze input/output examples
   - Identify edge cases

2. **Planning**
   - Work through small examples manually
   - Draw out data structures/visualizations
   - Consider multiple approaches

3. **Implementation**
   - Write clean, commented code
   - Follow best practices
   - Consider code reusability

4. **Review & Optimization**
   - Analyze time/space complexity
   - Consider alternative solutions
   - Document learnings and insights
